# Mystical Name Lists for Stellaris
Created by LilSandi

## Overview
A collection of name lists for Stellaris with a "mystic" theme, and that use only English words, so you can actually read your Empire's names. Currently only the actual names and the scripts to generate them are here, the mod files will be added when it's done, and the notes/scripts are shipped off somewhere else.

### Mystical 1
Mystical 1 is inspired by British Peerage titles and geological names. Character names are inspired by Tamrielic Argonian names from The Elder Scrolls. (I'll actually fill these out later, I'm not about to do it manually, so when I'm updating/unifying the scripts I'll add in a function to generate example names for this section.)
